# GetAJobGame

This repository contains a small Godot 4 prototype for a job-searching
life simulator. The player can move around and interact with a simple
`JobBoard` of listings. Autoload scripts (`GameManager.gd`,
`LocationManager.gd`, and `Calendar.gd`) provide basic structure while
`Main.tscn` loads a minimal scene.

Open the project in Godot 4 to see the player move and select job
listings. The scripts are placeholders for future systems like skills,
money management, and NPC interactions.
