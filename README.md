# GetAJobGame

This repository contains a very small Godot 4 prototype. It includes a
simple player that can move around and a basic farm grid made from
dynamically generated tiles. The project is configured to autoload the
`GameManager.gd` and `LocationManager.gd` scripts and uses `Main.tscn`
as the main scene.

Open the project in Godot 4 to see the player moving on a 5x5 grid of
farm tiles.
